We are finally back! ðŸŽ‰ With all the chicanery of COVID-19 these last few years it is nice to return to the practice of governing ones own micronation.

You may have noticed some significant changes to the website. First off, its actually up again. I am not quite sure when it went down but moving forward it will remain up and will hopefully have more content consistently posted. Second, you have probably noticed the new theme. Gone are all the traces of Wordpress as we have migrated entirely to the [Open Source CMS GRAV](https://getgrav.org/). I do want to give a shout out to Tyler Moore who created the [Tesseract](https://tesseracttheme.com/) Wordpress theme. Back in 2015 when I first started on the website side of French Creek, his tutorials started me on an exciting journey of website creation and I used Tesseract in most sites I created. It is sad to see those old days go, but I feel it's time to branch out with a new CMS with room to grow.

Old posts that I can salvage from archive.org and the various nots I have will be posted as I get around to them. Going forward I will hopefully have more to share about what has been happening in our lands.
