##Directorate For the Creation of Useless Directorates
One of the many privileges of government is the right to create new and incompetent branches of government to inconvenience the lives of its citizenry. Many nations accomplish this by their legislative branch voting on legislation just to prove that they are doing something. We have found this inefficient, as it requires a politician to realize they are useless and have not accomplished anything towards the inconveniencing of their citizens.

We speed this process along by maintaining a directorate whose sole purpose is to create new and inefficient arms of government for our citizens to complain about. The D.F.C.U.D. is proud of its mission and promises to leave no option unexplored in our pursuit for the most useless directorate!

##Directorate of Immigration, Customs & Excise
The brave men and women of D.I.C.E. are the first line in securing the borders of our nation. Our current border is rather porous but one day we will have the perfect border with the largest wall in history, and make America pay for it!
