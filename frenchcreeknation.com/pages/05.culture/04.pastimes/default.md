NATIONAL PASTIMES
The Principality of French Creek is a hard working nation that is always striving for greatness, however all work and no play, makes the Imperator an ill-mannered despot. Work hard play hard is the motto of the citizens of French Creek and is reflected in national past times.

Board Game Night
Board Game night is held every Saturday and is open to both citizens and non citizens alike. It is the desire of the First Prince to find and play the greatest board games in the land and as such the Royal Board Game Society scourers the globe to find them. They have found some of the best (and strangest) board games in the lands and catalogue their eternal quest on their webpage below.
