The Fez
Traditionally, a hat in the shape of a truncated cone or a short cylinder but may include a Chapeau style; the Fez is the official hat of the Principality. It is considered inappropriate to be outside without some form of head covering and though the Fez has lost popularity in our military it still is very popular with the citizenry.
