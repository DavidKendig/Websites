The Garbage Plate
An innocuous dish despite the rather unusual name, and the national food of the Principality of French Creek. Ever since the First Prince was a little boy he enjoyed traveling to the foreign city of Rochester to partake in this delight.

 

While the history of this dish is shrouded in mystery, there is no denying the iconic nature of this dish both from our New York Neighbors and within the Principality.
