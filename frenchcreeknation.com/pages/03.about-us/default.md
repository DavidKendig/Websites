#ABOUT US
We are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronation">micronation</a> located at the center of the map where the Prime Meridian and the Equator meet in the Gulf of Guinea. How we arrived at this state is a journey unto itself, so strap in, grab a cold one and prepare for one wild ride.

Our story begins on a lazy Wednesday afternoon in December 2012. Having kicked back from a long day at shop, our fearless leader, feeling a bit of nostalgia for his college days, popped in a copy of his newly acquired copy of <a href="https://channelawesome.com/nostalgia-critic-kickassia-review/">Kickassia</a> intended nothing more than a mindless afternoon in peace. Intrigued by what he thought was just a fictional nation created for the film, what transpired instead was a head first dive down the rabbit hole, researching the micronation of [The Republic of Molossia](http://www.molossia.org/index.html) and the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronation">micronationalisim</a> in general.

That night,12/12/2012, our fearless leader declared himself First Prince of the Principality of French Creek. His barracks room and all surrounding lands were claimed by the new Principality and a constitution for the new lands was enacted.

Our self assigned duty was to protest and protect these lands from further encroachment by those who whished to further disrupt its natural beauty. And for proof of how badly the lands needed protection, I point you towards a famous quote from our Dear Leader...
